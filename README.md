In-class Lab: HDFS and Linux Commands Using a Virtual Machine

Objective:
This lab project involved using a virtual machine to execute Linux and HDFS commands, demonstrating proficiency in file management, command-line tools, and research skills.

Key Tasks:

Created a personal folder in the Linux file system and added a text file (YourName.txt) with content using a text editor.
Created a directory in HDFS under the root directory, named BigDataFirstName.
Transferred the YourName.txt file from the local Linux file system to the HDFS directory.
Explored and demonstrated a new HDFS command, citing the external source.
Researched and documented the difference between hadoop fs and hdfs dfs commands, citing references.
Identified a new Linux command not covered in class, explained its functionality, and showcased its usage with screenshots.
Outcome:
This project enhanced understanding of file system operations in Linux and HDFS, reinforced command-line skills, and demonstrated the ability to research and apply new concepts efficiently.
